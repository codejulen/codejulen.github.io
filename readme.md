# codejulen.github.io

This react app was built out of boredom to track all of the amazing things that I do. Seriously, I'm not trying to brag, but I do a lot of cool things aside from coding all day, and I wanted a place to put everything together and show off my skills in multiple areas.

## Features

### A Photography Portfolio

Simple portfolio, built with React, with much help from material-ui.

### Dishcord Movie Nights

A side project I built for Dish, a good friend of mine who streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/imdishrag) and manages a public [Discord](https://discord.gg/tNBh8eK) server.

You can find the changelog of updates [here](https://github.com/codejulen/codejulen.github.io/blob/master/src/components/Dish/CHANGELOG.md).

The project's intention was to track all of the movies that the text channel, **#film**, wanted to watch. Initially the list of movies was a Google Doc that made me cry a little. Organizing movies that people submitted and wanted to watch naturally felt like a programming question, and I thought, "_why not make something meaningful as a little bit of react practice?_"

Features:

- Good vibes only
- Fun movie posters
- Free API usage! Shoutout to [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
- Filtering!
- A heartfelt footer.
